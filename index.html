        <h2>My Journey</h2>
        <p>I'm Christopher, known as Techriz, a Nigerian forex trader and freshly minted BPharm graduate. From late nights studying pharmacy to mastering the markets, my journey wasn’t easy. As a struggling trader, I faced sleepless nights, family doubts, and the grind of balancing responsibilities. But through grit and precision, I turned dreams into reality.</p>
        <p>Starting with just 500 followers, I built a community of over 113K on X in two years, sharing trading insights and mentorship that’s helped many achieve financial freedom. My love for tech shines through in my gadget podcast, blending my analytical mind with curiosity.</p>
        <p>Today, as a max-allocated FundedNext trader, I trade six-figure accounts with discipline and teach others to do the same—proving every skyscraper starts as a sketch.</p>

                    <h3>My Struggles: The Untold Story</h3>
                    <p>Trading wasn’t just a career choice—it was a lifeline. I remember the sting of my first blown account, the shame of hiding losses from my family, and the anxiety of watching my last savings dwindle. There were days I questioned my path, nights I couldn’t sleep, and moments when quitting seemed easier than pushing forward.</p>
                    <p>But every setback was a lesson. I learned to embrace risk, to study charts until dawn, and to silence the noise of doubters. I juggled pharmacy exams with market analysis, often sacrificing sleep and social life. The pressure was immense—one wrong trade could mean starting over. Yet, I refused to let fear dictate my future.</p>
                    <p>What kept me going? The vision of financial freedom, the desire to prove myself, and the belief that discipline would pay off. I found mentors, joined trading communities, and documented every win and loss. Slowly, the tides turned. Consistency replaced chaos, and confidence grew from every hard-earned lesson. Techriz wasn't always the enviable success story posting six-figure withdrawals today. Born Christopher, he started as a "lost boy" and tired-eyed pharmacy student in a modest Nigerian family, juggling endless nights of textbook cramming with the mental grind of charting markets that nearly drove him "crazy." Responsibilities loomed large: as the first son, he felt the weight of actualizing family dreams amid zero parental support—his dad once mistook his late-night
                       tutorials for cult meetings and seized his phone. Yet, he persisted, turning down distractions and building resilience through sheer determination.
His journey kicked off humbly:

Early Hustle: Began as a personal assistant (PA) to a big-name trader "CIRA MARESSE,".
<br>Tech Spark:</br> His gadget obsession led to hosting a podcast where he geeked out on tech with friends and guests, blending his analytical mind with curiosity.
<br>Organic Growth:</br>No overnight fame—grew his X account from 500 followers to 150K+ over two consistent years by dropping genuine value, proving "determination and excitement" can scale anyone.
<br>Trading Breakthrough:</br> From struggling with small stakes (less than "1 figure" at times) to mastering the charts. He conquered prop challenges, landing a prestigious FundedNext partnership—not by hype, but by proving it through impeccable entries and risk management.

Balancing worlds, he just graduated pharmacy with flying colors, literally "saving lives in the labs" while teaching folks to "make money" in the markets. It's a dual mastery: pharmacist by day, trader by trade—proving he's not just profitable, but principled. He's beyond wizardry; every skyscraper starts as a sketch, and before "Techriz" was the brand, there was just Christopher, the boy dreaming big.</p>
                    <p>Now, I share my story so others know: the journey is tough, but the reward is real. If you’re struggling, remember—every pro was once a beginner who refused to give up.</p>
